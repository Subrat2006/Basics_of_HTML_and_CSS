# Basics of HTML and CSS
This is a basic HTML Code and the thing to be noted is:
```The codes inside the <style></style> in the head is the codes of CSS```
```
Some of the Full Forms are:
1) HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
2) CSS - Cascading Stylesheet
3) JS - Javascript
```
The Codes are as follows:
<img src = "HTML Code 1.png"></img>
You will also find the HTML Codes in the files section!

# Points to Remember:
The HTML Code will contain some codes like:
<img src = "HTML Code 2.png"></img>
These are the Comments in HTML ðŸ‘†
```
The HTML Files have .html or .htm as their extension!
```
```
Write <p></p> to start a paragraph and all the contents of paragraph between these 2
```
```
This is the Boiler Plate of HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

You can also make HTML File and CSS File seperately and after that, you can put a command for attaching the CSS File to HTML File!
For this, you just have to write this in your head o the HTML Document:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="Name of your CSS File ">

REMEMBER:
The CSS File have aan extension as .css
```
OR
```
You can just write all the codes of CSS in the HTML File itself! [By putting <style></style> in the Head of the HTML File
```
